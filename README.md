# Chicken-Hunter

A game that I developed as part of a group project with some friends back in my year 1 game design class in HS, back in 2014(?) we never quite finsihed it, but it is currently in a playable albeit buggy state, ~~I may go back and finish it so it is actually a working product~~ THIS PROJECT IS DEAD!

# How to play
W A S D: Move

Left Mouse: shoot

# Issues

## 1. Bullets spawn under ground


## 2. Some buildings don't have collision meshes


## 3. Some chickens don't move


## 4. The scale of buildings is a bit off.
